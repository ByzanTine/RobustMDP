## To run the codes for the aircraft routing part:

### Reproduce the demo shown in the presentation in class:

Run ```bash plot_classic.py``` and ```bash plot_classic2.py``` to watch the robust and nominal path for the squared storm case. Run ```bash plot_normal.py``` and ```bash plot_normal2.py``` to watch the robust and nominal path for the randomly generated case.

To reproduce the results in the report, run ```bash normal.sh```. To change the setting, you may want to commont or uncomment the code blocks started from [here](https://github.com/zhusz2/RobustMDP/blob/master/nominal-mdp/robust_value_iteration.py#L235).
